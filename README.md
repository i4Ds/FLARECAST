# FLARECAST

The FLARECAST prediction system will be one of the first fully automated forecasting systems for solar-flare prediction. It will extract the physical properties of solar active regions in near real-time and compare them to data from previous solar activity. The online tool will be of use to space-weather forecasters and researchers in Europe and around the world.
